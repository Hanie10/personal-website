  <h3 style="color:#895b5b">Families are a blessing not everyone is fortunate enough to have. However, those who do, sometimes do not value this blessing. My family has been always by my side in ups and downs. There are five people in my family including me, my parents, sister and brother. In 2017 at the age of nineteen, I lost the man who I admired the most in my life, my father due to blood cancer. The pain of the lost still burdens me to this day. My mom is the most beautiful woman in the world to me. My mother is government pensioner. My sister is the eldest among three of us. She is very responsible and generous. My brother is very caring and understanding in our family but sometime he can be a Hulk and I am the youngest in the family.</h3>
